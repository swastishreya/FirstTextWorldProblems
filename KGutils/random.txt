You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can make out a fridge. You make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a raw pork chop and a knife on the stove. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

There is an open plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can make out a fridge. You make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a knife on the stove. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

There is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
